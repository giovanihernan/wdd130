            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Salmon River Experience first applied for our outfitters' license in 1978 with the goal of providing
                the highest
                quality, affordable whitewater adventures available, which are both fun and adventurous while at the
                same time sensitive
                to the cultural and environmental needs of the river. SRE started with a yellow school bus, 4 used
                rafts and 16 life
                jackets. Now, over three decades later we are able to accommodate over 300 people a day with a fleet
                of self bailing
                rafts, kayaks, and support vehicles.</p>
