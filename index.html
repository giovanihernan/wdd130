        <p>Hello! My name is Rodrigo Hernandez, I am from Guatemala, I am 21 years old and I my favorite food is
            Flautas.
            While I was making this page I was thinking about
            how much I enjoyed
            to listen to music when I am doing my homework and how it helps me to accomplish it also I like to play
            video games and play
            basquetball in my free time.
            Something that I enjoy to do it is driving while I am driving along the streets my mind get peace and
            comfort.
            I like to collect Hotwheels and keep them for the future for my future Son, I like to spend time with my
            family traveling along the country and discovering new places.
            When I am going through this process of learning CSS and HTML I have learned how to use basic structures and
            how small thing can make the difference.

        <p>Guatemala, a Central American country south of Mexico, is home to volcanoes, rainforests and ancient Mayan
            sites. The
            capital, Guatemala City, features the stately National Palace of Culture and the National Museum of
            Archaeology and
            Ethnology. Antigua, west of the capital, contains preserved Spanish colonial buildings. Lake AtitlÃ¡n, formed
            in a
            massive volcanic crater, is surrounded by coffee fields and villages</p>
